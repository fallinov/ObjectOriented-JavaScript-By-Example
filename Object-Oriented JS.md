## Review Provided Code

### Assignment:

1. Download the project files [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/treehouse-project-downloads/ObjectOrientedJavaScriptByExample.zip). 
2. Look over the HTML and CSS provided.
3. Take note of the different directories. 
4. If you have any questions, checkthe Treehouse Community for related discussions, and then post any unique questions there.

### Course format

Welcome to your first instruction step! You'll be receiving all of  your instructions and guidelines in these text-based steps so you can  easily reference them while you're coding. It's important that you read  each of the instruction pages (including this one!) thoroughly. At the  top of each instruction page I'll provide the assignment, with any  relevant details, guidelines, notes, and resources to follow.

This course doesn't use workspaces. All of your starting project files are provided for you [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/treehouse-project-downloads/ObjectOrientedJavaScriptByExample.zip).  You're going to be creating many files as you work through the course  project, so the provided code may seem a little empty. All you'll find  right now are empty folders, an index.html file, and a style.css file.

### What to do if you get stuck

If you get stuck on a challenge or assignment, don't worry! Make an  attempt, and then just head to the solution video. If you really want to  try it on your own, asking questions in the Treehouse community can be a  great start, but try not to get too hung up. 



## Planning the Classes

### Assignment:

1. Consider the different game components discussed so far and think  about how these components could be represented as objects (if you think  they should be represented as objects).
2. Brainstorm or write out responses to the questions on this page.
3. Write down the classes you think this game should include.
4. Optionally, discuss your class choices in the Treehouse Community.

### Object Design in "Four in a Row"

Now that you're familiar with the game of "Four in a Row" and you've  had a chance to review the HTML and CSS of the game, it's time to start  thinking about object design.

App architecture can be very complicated, even in simple games like  "Four in a Row". There are countless approaches, design patterns,  frameworks and tools you could utilize when architecting an app. 

As you become more involved in the industry you'll find that the  opinions on these things vary drastically. You'll also find that nothing  is set in stone: In almost every circumstance developers will rework a  solution or iterate on it several times before putting it in production.  Even then, apps are continuously in cycles of refactoring and  improvement. 

What's important is not focusing on the "best" way to do something,  but instead focusing on developing a codebase that is planned, logical,  organized, documented, and tested. 

That's why before you start coding "Four in a Row", you'll take the  time to map out the different ways you could organize your objects and  if you like, you'll discuss these considerations with other students in  the Treehouse Community.

To help you identify the different classes you might use in the development of this app, consider the following questions:

1. What are the different components of a "Four in a Row" game? For the  game to be complete, which of these components are required and which  are optional? Think about a physical version of the game, and see if  that helps.
2. Can you break down those components into smaller, or individual parts?
3. Where will you handle the game state and game logic: switching players, checking for winning moves, resetting the board, etc.?

*Note:* These brainstorming exercises are to practice figuring  out "where to start". The goal is for you to gain experience thinking  like a developer. While I hope that you take advantage of this practice  time, please note that we'll be using a previously developed solution as  we go through this course.

After completing the assignment, join me in the video that follows to  see my solution and the classes we'll be using moving forward.
